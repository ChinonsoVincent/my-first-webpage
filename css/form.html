            <h1>UNDERSTANDING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOUR OF FRESH AND YOUNG GRADUATES IN NIGERIA</h1>
            <p>
                We are currently conducting a study to understand the entrepreneurial behaviour of fresh and young graduates in Nigeria in the light of entrepreneurship programs in higher institutions and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme. Our target group, therefore, are graduates who served (or are serving) in NYSC between 2016 and 2021. If you are within this category of Nigerian graduates, kindly respond to this simple and short survey. You can also help us by sharing the link with other qualified friends and colleagues. Your personal identification is not required; and your response will be used solely for the purpose of the study. If you have any question, kindly contact us through: <br>
                makuachukwu.ojide@funai.edu.ng  or   agoziemjoyy@gmail.com <br>
                Thank you and kind regards. <br>
